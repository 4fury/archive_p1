Subject: [PATCH] rtlwifi: Improve handling of IPv6 packets
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2015 09:23:01 -0600

Routine rtl_is_special_data() is supposed to identify packets that need to
use a low bit rate so that the probability of successful transmission is
high. The current version has a bug that causes all IPv6 packets to be
labelled as special, with a corresponding low rate of transmission. A
complete fix will be quite intrusive, but until that is available, all
IPv6 packets are identified as regular.

This patch also removes a magic number.
